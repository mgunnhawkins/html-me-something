  <h1>From Teacher to Programmer</h1>
  <h2>Welcome to my Journey</h2>
  <h3>How it all began...</h3>
  <p class="p1"> When you were little, did someone ever ask you what you wanted to be when you grew up? I know that as a
    kindergarten teacher I asked my students that question many times. I know that I was asked that question and
    eventually, at the ripe old age of 6 I had my answer...teacher or doplphin trainer. Or better yet, why not both?</p>
