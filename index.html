  <h1>From Teacher to Programmer</h1>
  <h2>Welcome to my Journey</h2>
  <h3>How it all began...</h3>
  <p class="p1"> When you were little, did someone ever ask you what you wanted to be when you grew up? I know that as a
  kindergarten teacher I asked my students that question many times. I know that I was asked that question and
  eventually, at the ripe old age of 6 I had my answer...teacher or doplphin trainer. Or better yet, why not both?</p>

  <p>My maternal grandparents were both teachers too. My grandmother always was teaching me songs. She taught early
    childhood (she called it Nursery School back then). I was always singing her songs. Then, when I was 13 years old, my
    grandfather suddenly passed away. That was the first loss that I was capable of comprehending. When we attended his
    funeral, I saw 4 generations of people who were taught by my grandfather. I thought that if I could touch just a
    fraction of the lives that he did then my life would be worth something. </p>

  <p>I ended up teaching for 9.5 years and...for most of the time...I loved it. I taught Kindergarten for most of my
    teaching career and felt that it was a privilidge that I could teach people how to read. Then, cue in the pandemic and
    having a baby. Motherhood is no joke! Teaching virtually (plus a new grade), and having a baby at home who required a
    lot of attention was tricky. I was no longer my best self for me, my students or my family. I made the tough decision
    in March to step back from my teaching career in order to persue other interests.</p>
  
    <p>One upside to the pandemic was realising the power of educational technologogy. I decided that I wanted to use my
    teaching degree in conjunction with web development. There is so much value to integrating technology in classrooms. As
    both an educator annd programmer I feel that I will have a strong knowledge base to help make classroom learning richer
    through the use of technology and adding to te value of what teachers teach in the classroom.</p>
