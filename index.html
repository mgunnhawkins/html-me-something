        <h3>How it all began...</h3>
        <div>
            <p> When you were little, did someone ever ask you what you wanted to be when you grew up? I know that as a kindergarten teacher I asked my students that question many times. I know that I was asked that question and eventually, at the ripe old age of 6, I had my answer...teacher or dolphin trainer. Or better yet, why not both?</p>

            <p>My maternal grandparents were both teachers too. My grandmother always taught me songs. She taught early childhood (she called it Nursery School back then). I was always singing her songs. Then, when I was 13 years old, my grandfather suddenly passed away. That was the first loss that I was capable of comprehending. When we attended his funeral, I saw 4 generations of people who were taught by my grandfather. I thought that if I could touch just a fraction of the lives that he did then my life would be worth something.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>I ended up teaching for 9.5 years and...for most of the time...I loved it. I taught Kindergarten for most of my teaching career and felt that it was a privilege that I could teach people how to read. Then, cue in the pandemic and having a baby. Motherhood is no joke! Teaching virtually (plus a new grade), and having a baby at home who required a lot of attention was tricky. I was no longer my best self for me, my students or my family. I made the tough decision in March to step back from my teaching career in order to pursue other interests.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>One upside to the pandemic was realizing the power of educational technology. I decided that I wanted to use my teaching degree in conjunction with web development. There is so much value to integrating technology in classrooms. As both an
            educator and programmer, I feel that I will have a strong knowledge base to help make classroom learning richer through the use of technology.</p>
